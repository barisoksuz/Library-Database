-- 1. Query using JOIN: List all books along with their bookshelf genre and library name
SELECT Book.Title, Bookshelf.genre, Library.name AS LibraryName
FROM Book
JOIN Bookshelf ON Book.bookshelf_ID = Bookshelf.bookshelf_ID
JOIN Section ON Bookshelf.section_ID = Section.section_ID
JOIN Library ON Section.library_ID = Library.library_ID;

/*Explanation:
This query retrieves the title of each book together with the genre of its associated bookshelf and the name of the library where the book is located. It uses JOIN operations to combine data across multiple tables based on their foreign key relationships.
*/

SELECT Bookshelf.genre, COUNT(Book.book_ID) AS NumberOfBooks
FROM Book
JOIN Bookshelf ON Book.bookshelf_ID = Bookshelf.bookshelf_ID
GROUP BY Bookshelf.genre;

/*
